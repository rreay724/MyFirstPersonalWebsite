            Developer.</span
          >

          I was a Technical Recruiter for 13 years before transitioning to
          Development and I couldn't be happier.
          <br />
          <br />

          In 2017, I was working on filling a position for a Linux Systems
          Administrator who had an active Full Scope Polygraph clearance.
          Needless to say, these candidates are extremely hard to find. After
          days of searching, I came across a candidate who was the perfect fit.
          I noticed he didn't have a degree, only a Red Hat certification, which
          told me that he has a passion for this, and if he learned it on his
          own, he must be very driven. I submitted his resume to the manager and
          within a couple days he was in for an interview - he nailed it. The
          manager told me to make him an offer of 115k, so I got on the phone
          immediately to break the good news. His reply; "Heh, I'm actually
          making 170k right now"."Sorry, did you say One One Seven or One Seven
          Zero?". "One Seven Zero". As you may have guessed, we couldn't afford
          him, and the first thing that popped in my head was "I'm in the wrong
          business". I had attended a "Tech School" in 2001 where I used Linux,
          so I knew I could do it. I immediately signed up for LinuxAcademy.com
          and started studying for my Linux+ certification in hopes of becoming
          a Linux Systems Administrator myself. I started studying from ground
          zero in May 2017, and in October 2017 I received my Linux+
          certification.
          <br />
          <br />
          After receiving my Linux+ I started working with a couple managers at
          work to get some hands on experience on some of the programs we had
          while I worked towards my Network+ next. After a few weeks of it, I
          realized my heart was just not into the networking side of things. I
          kept studying anyways, and in April 2018 I built my first PC. A
          coworker of mine was working on a position for a Mobile Developer and
          was having an extremely hard time finding someone. She recommended
          that I learn mobile development because it seemed like they were in
          high demand. My initial thought - "I don't have the brain for that.
          There's no way I could learn how to code." That night, I went home to
          my newly built PC I put together a week prior, downloaded Android
          Studio and bought a course on Udemy to see how coding fit me. I chose
          Android development specifically so I could make things visually while
          also learning Java. I instantly fell in love with it. I studied every
          day learning as much as I could as fast as I could.
          <br />
          <br />
          A few months later in December 2018, I went on a work trip to St.
          Louis to help with recruiting candidates for positions we had with a
          government agency out there. Along on that trip was one of the lead
          developers on our IRAD team. We all went to dinner and I talked to her
          about coding and what I've been learning and how much I love it.Fast
          forward a few weeks and I was offered a position as a Software
          Developer on their team rebuilding a federal government agency
          application from the ground up. It was backend development using Java
          and Spring Boot. I couldn't believe it - my life just changed forever
          and it would have never happened if I didn't meet that one person on
          the work trip who gave me a chance.<br />
          After a year, I had fulfilled my duties on that specific program and
          was moved on to the IRAD team to work on other projects, which is
          where I discovered UI and Web Development, and realized it's a much
          better fit than only doing backend work. I enjoy backend work, but
          even more than that, I enjoy making visual projects.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you've stuck with me this long reading through my About Me, it is
          greatly appreciated and
          <a href="https://www.bobbyreaydevelopment.com/dude" target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >
          is a little easter egg I added to the site that you may enjoy (volume
          up). My passion for coding and hard work learning it brought me so
          much happiness and fulfillment in life. If you have any interest in
          coding, I hope my story inspires you to follow it and know that if I
          can do it, so can you.
